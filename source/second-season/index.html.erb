    <h2><i>Fuddy Meers</i> by David Lindsay-Abaire</h2></a>
    <p>A woman whose memory is erased when she sleeps…a limping, lisping "brother" who kidnaps her…an accomplice with a sock puppet...a husband with murky intentions…a gibberish-speaking mom…and a foul-mouthed teenage son. A farce about aphasia, and other oddities, from the playwright of Rabbit Hole.</p>
    <p><i>Fuddy Meers</i> runs January 10-19, 2014 at Nimbus Theatre. It is directed by Natalie Novacek. It features performances by Leif Jurgensen, Paul Rutledge, Matt Sciple, Noe Tallen, Karen Wiese-Thompson, and Katie Willer and the designs of Kiley Cermak and Daniel Ellis.</p>
