    <h2><i>Cul-de-Sac</i> by Daniel MacIvor</h2>
    <p>The first production of the season, Cul-de-Sac by Daniel MacIvor, tells the story of Leonard who narrates the events leading up to his murder while trying to understand them himself. In this one man show, <i>Wade A. Vaughn</i> will transform into the multiple characters who bear witness to Leonard’s life and death. Yet each of their stories, while internally consistent, tells a subtly different version of what happened, progressively coloring and transforming our understanding of the characters as we think we had come to know them. In a headlong rush we understand that everyone’s story inevitably dead-ends at precisely the bottom of the preconceptions they brought to its telling.</p>
    <p><i>Cul-de-Sac</i> runs May 17-26, 2013 at Open Eye Figure Theatre. It is directed by Natalie Novacek. It features a performance by Wade A. Vaughn and the designs of Katharine Horowitz and Stephanie Richards.</p>
    <p>During the run of <i>Cul-de-Sac</i>, Loudmouth Collective will give a workshop of a one woman show being commissioned by an up-and-coming playwright in the national theatre scene. With performance by Leigha Horton, direction by Natalie Novacek, and a new script by Chelsea M. Marcantel, <i>Much Louder than This</i> will be featured on May 22nd, 2013 at Open Eye Figure Theatre. <b>Drink This Play: A New Play Workshop & Happy Hour.</b>

    <h2><i>Fuddy Meers</i> by David Lindsay-Abaire</h2>
    <p>Claire has a rare form of psychogenic amnesia that erases her memory whenever she goes to sleep. This morning, like all mornings, she wakes up a blank slate. Her chipper husband comes in with a cup of coffee, explains her condition, hands her a book filled with all sorts of essential information, and he disappears into the shower. A limping, lisping, half-blind, half-deaf man in a ski mask, pops out from under her bed and claims to be her brother, there to save her. Claire's info book is quickly discarded, and she's hustled off to the country-house of her mother, a recent stroke victim whose speech has been reduced to utter gibberish. Claire's journey gets even more complicated when a dimwitted thug with a foul-mouthed hand puppet pops up at a window, and her driven husband and perpetually stoned son show up with a claustrophobic lady-cop that they've kidnapped. Every twist and turn in this funhouse plot bring Claire closer to revealing her past life and everything she thought she'd forgotten. It's one harrowing and hilarious turn after another on this roller coaster ride through the day of an amnesiac trying to decipher her fractured life. This poignant and brutal new comedy traces one woman's attempt to regain her memory while surrounded by a curio-cabinet of alarmingly bizarre characters.</p>
    <p><i>Fuddy Meers</i> runs January 10-19, 2014 at Nimbus Theatre. It is directed by Natalie Novacek. It features performances by Leif Jurgensen, Paul Rutledge, Matt Sciple, Noe Tallen, Karen Wiese-Thompson, and Katie Willer and the designs of Kiley Cermak and Daniel Ellis.</p>
